// holy fuck i added the fucking if statement inside for region you fucking head ass!!!!!!!!
// this fucking question is retarded, why the fuck would i need to learn scope, ill deal with scope creep when it fucking comes and it's common sense to keep the associated variables inside the function and have global variables separated!!!!!! what the fuk!!!!
